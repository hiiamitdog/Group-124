2. Description:
# The game we chose to design is a poker game of five card draw. In which, each player would be dealt five cards from a deck of 52. The winner is determined based on the ranks of the five hands. A primary program handles the courses of a game, including but not limited to asking the number of players, initializing the deck, annoucing the winner. A secondary program is required to generate a text file, called "ranks.txt" which contains all 2,598,960 distinct combinations of hands, in order of ranks to return a corresponding index.
